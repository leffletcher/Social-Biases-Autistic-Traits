Experiment code and stimuli for 'Autistic Traits, Communicative Efficiency, and Social Biases Shape Language Learning in Autistic and Allistic Learners'.

Images are contained in ./Images/ (the images were drawn by Sara Rolando, with assistance by Hanna Jarvinen, based on original stimuli provided by Holly Branigan.), and audio (from Amazon Polly) in ./Audio/

pilot_iwo.js contains the no-bias informative case condition.
pilot_rwo.js contains the no-bias redundant case condition.

iwo_current.js contains the bias for no informative case condition.
rwo_current.js contains the bias for redundant case condition.

stimuli.js contains all defined blocks of trials, as well as post-test questions. 

jquery-3.6.0.js and bag_words.js (modified plugin by Mora Maldonado) are required files for the experiment to work. bag_words.js should be placed within the jsPsych plugins folder.
